Ebuild repo for pkgcraft-related software consisting of live ebuilds for
pkgcraft-based tools and libraries that may be used to update the official
Gentoo repo.

For the most part, ebuilds for releases won't be added to this repo; however,
the live ebuilds should remain updated allowing them to be directly copied to
releases assuming the live ebuild is from when the target release was tagged.

In addition, KEYWORDS in this repo will match the main development machine(s)
and CI environment. Use packages from the official Gentoo repo (and submit
keywording requests there) for additional architecture and stable support.
